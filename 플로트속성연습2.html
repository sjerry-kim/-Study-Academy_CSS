                What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy 
                text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
                in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
                with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
